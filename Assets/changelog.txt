oh god oh fuck version control moment
10/11:
Created DamageInfo class for universalizing passed damage information
Created IHealthInterface class for universal healthholders

Bullets now use DamageInfo
onBulletHit now passes the Damageinfo, not the bullet
Weapons now have a field for their user, which will pass said user to any damage/bullets created. Framework for hitnumbers/kill tracking.

All "mouse" inputs scripts for the player are now in playerAttack.cs
Mouse sensitivity reduced, players can now use the secondary click to toggle "aim" mode which reduces it even further
